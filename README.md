Practicing github

Hello fellow internet humans!

I'm currently studying CS at college and I figured learning Github would be a nifty skill to have!
Oh, my name is Mariah, that might be important. I also really like learning languages (like Japanese and Javascript!)
and in my hobbies include eating, swimming, coffee, reading, and sometimes stress-baking.
